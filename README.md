Food Order Application

## Getting Started

This project is a simple food ordering application.

Application Support below functions:
-	Getting food data from backend API using http request. 
-	Ability to browse the food based on its category.
-	Ability to mark any item as favorite.
-	Ability to remove favorite mark.
-	Ability to add multiple items and quantity to shopping cart before placing the order.
-	Ability to empty shopping cart.
-	Ability to remove specific item from shopping cart.

I used Provider for state management, and shared prefrences to save state value after closing the application.

Packages I used:
- http
- shared_preferences
- provider
- fluttertoast

Todo:
- Add detailed screen for every item.
- Add the availability to place the order from item screen beside cart screen.
- Add some cool function like get address of the user with geocoding and geolocation.
- Add membership systems and allow user to sign up to get more personal experience.
